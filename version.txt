(Major version).(Minor version).(Revision number)

1.2.1: Improving physics and tuning player 'feel'

-Various bug fixes
01/02/21
-Fixed an issue where the player would sometimes slide past wall slots when entering from above
-Fixed an issue where the player could get caught between a wall and floor slot
-Returned double jump to its pre physics update behaviour
09/02/21
-Completely rebuilt the jumping system
10/02/21
-There is now wall jumping that correctly pushes you away from the wall
-Jumping or falling off a surface removes the first jump, so you only ever have one jump in mid air
-Wall jumping in a vertical tunnel will boost you straight up instead of away from the wall
11/02/21
-Built a system that makes jumping off objects more forgiving by delaying collision end events where neccassary
-Jumping while moving in a horizontal tunnel now bosts you forward
-Implemented jumping up through slots above the player
15/02/21
-Improved player physics performance
-PlayerEnds no longer default to level end mode
-Editor mode widget now cycles through tools instead of opening a submenu

1.2.0: Physics build

-Rebuilt entire physics system from the ground up
-Physics now runs correctly independant of frame rate
-It is now possible to rotate the player by bouncing off the environment
-Player now has inerta and will take a moment to change direction/speed up
-Player now has friction, pushing into walls will slow down falling or jumping
-Player no longer gets stuck on walls
-There are no longer sometimes slots the player can't jump up into
-Previous checkpoint button added to pause menu (there are bugs with the physics that sometimes require a restart)
-PlayerEnds now require the correct orientation of player by default
-There are now orientation settings for PlayerEnds
-Quadtree visualisation has been removed and replaced with physics assist visualisation
-Spikes now have pixel perfect hitboxes
-Levels will now automatically end if all slots are filled

1.1.3: Early playtester patch

-Various bug fixes
11/01/21
-Added counter clockwise rotation to editor side toolbar
-Added rotation and proper collision to Spike
-Updated APDE prievew asset management code so it works on older devices
-Added title screen
12/01/21
-Implemented levels folder in game data that can be played in sequence from the title screen
-Implemented seperate menus for demo mode and editor mode
-Editor debug text now correctly scales to screen size
-Modifying the current PlayerStart tile will now also modify the first player
-Tiles now appear in alphabetical order in the editor bottom toolbar
-There are now widgets for adding and removing camera colliders
13/01/12
-Implemented CameraChange colliders
14/01/12
-Pages now resize when resizing views
-Rebuilt page saving/loading system
-Implemented delta time for UI animations
15/01/12
-Implemented delta time for camera movement
-Implemented fixed time step for player physics (requires new physics system)
-Fixed editor ui animation sync issues

1.1.0:	Christmas break patch

-Various bug fixes
-Performance doubled in level view by only using transformations where required
-Performance doubled in page view by prerendering pages and only drawing them when on screen
-Types can be excluded from Pages (specific exclusion coming soon)
-Implemented Spike object that kills the player on contact
-Pages now have accurate selection boxes
-Advanced PlayerEnds now fully implemented, PlayerEnds can require a specific tile
-Added new level widget to the save/load menu
-UI now scales correctly for all phones
-Editor side widgets are now only shown when needed for current selection
-Editor side now has ui background
-Tiles and Images can now be rotated in 90 degree increments from editor side
-Removed Tile fipping to simplify puzzle creation
-Pages now rerender whenever switching to the page view, so level changes are always visible
-PlayerEnds now draw an arrow pointing to the next Tile the player will become
-It is now possible to become a Tile that you have already been
-Improved camera backend (still needs significant work)
-Added temp app icon
-Rewrote asset management code so that it works in both APDE preview and exported apk
-Exported working apk

1.0.0:	First internal alpha build
-levels have start and end states, it is now possible to make fully playable levels
-fully working level editor (missing some basics, such as advanced CameraChanges and advanced PlayerEnds)
-fully working save and load system (missing some quality of life touches)
-level files now use .unplayed
-bad: physics and animation speed deturmined by frame rate
-bad: uses temp physics engine
-bad: title screen and main menu(s) yet to be implemented
