name can be anything at the start, they are loaded in alphabetically, so take that into account

they end with two sets of digits: []x[] and []_[]

[]x[] is used to determine their size [width]x[height], these dimentions indicate size in grid paper squares, 
so 1x1 means the loaded image will be exactly the size of one grid paper square.

[]_[] is used to determine options [fixed size]_[draw shadow]
1 = 'true' for either of these, any other digit = 'false'
